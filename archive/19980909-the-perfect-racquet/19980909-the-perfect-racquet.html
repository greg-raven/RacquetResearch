	On Wilmot McCutchen&rsquo;s Web site, he contends that a nearly perfect racket can be created by adding a five-ounce counterweight to the butt end of a tennis racket.
</p>

<p>
	On a sunny Sunday afternoon, I traded ground strokes with McCutchen, using a dirt-cheap Wilson Kannon racket. The vibration and instability of the racquet made it almost unusable.
</p>

<p>
	Then I hit with a Kannon modified with five ounces of lead shot, contained in a hollow plastic cap nailed to the end of the racquet. No vibration. Smooth, powerful strokes. I wonder if my Saturday morning tennis partner would notice.
